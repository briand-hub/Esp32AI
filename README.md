# Esp32AI

Simple C++17 Neural Network (NN), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Deep Learning for Esp32 on IDF from scratch.

## Intro

After Espressif's ESP32-S3 and devkits derivates (such as ESP-EYE), I'd like to write an easy library in C++17 as alternative to ESP-DL and ESP-NN, working with IDF version 5.0. 

This library could also be used in Windows or Linux o.s. for testing and fun.

Style is always my own: simple code, well formatted and widely commented. Also, in order to refresh my skills on AI I will attach my remarks: this will be a library and tutorial with examples just for my fun and free time.

## Coming soon
