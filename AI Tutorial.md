# My AI notes and remarks

This file contains notes, remarks collected in years and years. I had to refresh some concepts and theory before doing this fun project. Hope this short tutorial will help you to understand AI and deep learning better. 

This is a learn-by-doing tutorial and every step of project is there documented and explained in detail, with math and theory.

## Basics - theory

Biology

## Machine learning

Techniques, introduction

## What is a Neural Network (NN)

Concepts, input, layers, weights, activation...

### Neural network types

short, pics and links 

### Forward feeding

### Backpropagation

### Most used functions and derivatives

## Deep learning

what is, scheme for my remarks

## What is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

### Kernels

### Pooling

### FCN (Fully Connected Network)

### Image formats

## Conclusions

future technology, creative, human being, "answers", state of art, train data quality is everything!
